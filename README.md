# RAG Insights Engine

*Advanced RAG system for document insights with hybrid search and multi-stage LLM processing*

## Overview

A production-ready RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that transforms document embeddings into intelligent insights through multi-stage LLM processing and hybrid search. This system focuses exclusively on the "intelligence layer" - querying existing embeddings, hybrid search, LLM calls for insights, caching, and performance monitoring.

## Architecture

The system uses a Supabase-native architecture with Edge Functions for serverless processing:

- **Hybrid Search**: Combines vector similarity, full-text search, and structured filtering
- **Multi-Stage RAG**: Generates key questions, direct answers, and related questions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive latency tracking and optimization
- **Intelligent Caching**: Reduces LLM costs and improves response times
